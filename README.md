# ValueFunctionSurrogate

`functions.py` includes the necessary functions such as $g, V_t$ and simulation functions for surrogation. Those will be called by the codes in `NNcode_16_corrected.ipynb` to perform surrogation. 

`NNcode_16_corrected.ipynb` contains the main code chunks. It includes the entire surrogation procedure, NN interpretation and testing. 

The csv files will be explained in `NNcode_16_corrected.ipynb`.
